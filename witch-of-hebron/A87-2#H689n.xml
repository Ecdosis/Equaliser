<note resp="MJS">Last two lines of the poem. The lines that follow, and those on pp. 699, 701, 702, 745 and 746, would seem to be draft revisions of a complete version that has been lost except for these two lines. See <ref target="H689k">H689k</ref>, <ref target="H689l">H689l</ref> and <ref target="H689m">H689m</ref> for these fragments.</note>
