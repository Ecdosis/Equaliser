<note resp="MJS">Two non-contiguous fragments from Part VI. The version in A97 has been consulted in deciphering this difficult hand. For other fragments from Part VI in this manuscript see <ref target="H689l">H689l</ref></note>

<l>Had quashed a bargain that was quite complete</l>
<l>Save in the <del>hand over</del><add>final payment</add> of the gold</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del> Which some <del>old</del> men cursing had delayed</l>
<l>And in which luckless circumstance, 'twas plain</l>
<l>That both my admirable parents saw</l>
<l>The unkindest cut of all.</l>

<l>My worthy parents tenderly embraced me</l>
<l>With many tears, protesting that I was</l>
<l>The life light of their eyes—their rose of joy;</l>
<l>Then stretched their hands <del>of</del><add>out</add> for the Persian's gold</l>
<l>And hurried off to tell it o'er in secret—</l>
<l>The dear recovered <del>hoard</del><add>treasure</add> they so late</l>
<l>Had mourned, as lost for ever. On that night</l>
<l>I was packed carefully on a camel's back</l>
<l>Beside a case of porcelain pipes and jimcracks,</l>
<l>And carried Persia-ward, by stages long,</l>
<l>From the circassian mountains.</l>

<l part="F">At the Court</l>

<note resp="DS">Moved from h68l, because it already occurs in another fragment there, so it must belong to another version. Since h689m is also a collection of ragments from Part VI this seems an appropriate place.</note>

<l>My hid feet rowed me) graceful as a swan!</l>
