<lg><l>Again I lived—again I felt. But now</l>
<l>The winds of heaven seemed under me, and I</l>
<l>Was sweeping, like the Spirit of the storm</l>
<l>That bellowed round me, in the murky glooms</l>
<l>That heaved and rolled with a <del>vast</del><add>wide</add> manifold motion</l>
<l>Tenfold more mighty than the <del>t</del><add>darkling</add> swells</l>
<l>Of ocean, wrestling with a midnight gale!</l>
<l>The wild winds tossed me! I was drenched throughout</l>
<l>With heavy moister, and at intervals</l>
<l>Amid the ragged gaps of moving cloud</l>
<l>Methought I saw <del>a</del><add>dim glimpses of the sun</add></l>
<l>Hanging aloft, as if in drear eclipse.</l>
<l>But gradually my senses cleared, and I</l>
<l>Grew conscious that a new change was upon me!</l>
<l><del>Than</del><add>Then</add> glancing at my limbs, I saw that they</l>
<l>Were cothed with plumage; at the same time, too,</l>
<l>I felt the tension of high taloned claws,</l>
<l>As they worked closing, with a fierce desire</l>
<l>And sudden eagernes for blood and prey!</l>
<l>An impulse to pursue and to destroy</l>
<l>Both on the earth and in the air, ran quick</l>
<l>Out from my heart and shivered in my wings</l>
<l>And as a thing more central yet, I felt</l>
<l>Regnant within, throned o'er all, a lone</l>
<l>And sullen, yet majestic sense of pride.</l>
<l>Twas plain that I who had aforetime been</l>
<l>Crushed out of human nature, into that</l>
<l>Of a wild beast, had thence again been crushed</l>
<l>Into the being of <del>a</del><add>some</add> mighty <del>bird—</del>thing</l>
<l><app><rdg><del>An Eagle</del></rdg><rdg><del>creature</del></rdg><rdg>That now swept</rdg></app> sailing <del>with</del><add>on</add> wide van-like wings</l>
<l>Amid the whirls of an aerial storm,</l>

<pb n="142" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689c/145"/>

<l>That out extending, in its murky mass</l>
<l>Hung heaving, like a black tent-roof, <metamark>x</metamark><note>The larger Arab tents are often flat tapped; and the tents of <lb/>Kedak", we know, were <hi rend="ul">black</hi>, even in the days of Solomon.</note> o'er all</l>
<l>The floor of Africa.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l part="F">Still on I swept,</l>
<l>And still as far as my keen vision <del>passed</del><add>went</add></l>
<l>That now was gifted with a power that seemed</l>
<l>To <del><unclear/></del><add>pierce</add> all space, I saw the vapors roll <del>;</del><add>.</add></l>
<l>But <app><rdg><del>then</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>now</del></rdg>
<rdg>soon</rdg></app> in the remotest distance <del>were</del><add>they</add></l>
<l><del>Now</del><add>Were</add> different, as touched with <del>sunset</del><add>sunny</add> splendors</l>
<l>And nearing still to these I saw them dash</l>
<l>Like the wild surges of an uproused sea</l>
<l>Of molten gold against the marble crags</l>
<l>Of heaven-high mountains, which, though far below</l>
<l>My flight, yet<app><rdg><del>pierced</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>piercing</del>pierced up</rdg></app> through them all, <del>then</del><add>and</add> stood</l>
<l>Immovable a Fate. Beneath <del>all</del> me <add>all, lo</add></l>
<l>The grandam of the Kingdom of the air</l>
<l>Was circling in its magnitude immense!</l>
<l>A dread magnificence of which before</l>
<l>I might not even dream I saw its quick</l>
<l>And subtle interchange of forms and hues</l>
<l>That more &amp; more astonished: saw its black</l>
<l>And solid-seeming reservoirs of rain—</l>
<l>Its <app><rdg><del>fiery</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>livid</del></rdg>
<rdg><add>laboring</add></rdg></app> of the awful thunder</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">At last as onward still <add>I swept</add>, above</l>
<l>A milky mass of vapors, that spread flat</l>
<l>Like a vast floor of purest alabaster</l>
<l>Behold, reflected in its quick gleam</l>
<l>I saw a Shadow that swept on with me</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del><add>Reversed</add> as was the Lion's in the well:</l>
<l>With van-like wings, with eyeballs <del><unclear>writhing</unclear></del><add>seething</add> fire</l>

<pb n="143" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689c/146"/>

<l>With <del>brazen</del><add>taloned</add> claws an cruel down-bent beak:</l>
<l>The shadow of a monstrous Eagle—such</l>
<l>As seemed indeed, the mightiest that had sailed</l>
<l>The seas of space, since Adam named the first.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l><del>All shadow of doubt was</del><add>No doubt was left</add> me as to what <del>I was <unclear>E</unclear></del><add>I was:</add></l>
<l>My fated soul had passed into the form</l>
<l>Of this hugh Eagle <del>that</del><add>which</add> was shadowed there!</l>
<l>My first impression from the thing I saw</l>
<l>Was a cold horror! I was since again</l>
<l>Imprisoned in the <del>nature</del><add>being</add> of <del><unclear/></del> a Brute,</l>
<l>Albeit a noble on; and had again</l>
<l>To live for <del>centuries</del><add>ages,—centuries it might be,</add></l>
<l>In the brute <del>body</del><add>nature</add> of a being, yet</l>
<l>Inferior, by infinite descents,</l>
<l><app><rdg><del>I have</del> that dim <del>fr</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>Inferior to that dim</del></rdg>
<rdg>Even to that</rdg></app>
remnant of 
<app><rdg><del>my human mind</del></rdg>
<rdg><del><unclear/> mind</del></rdg>
<rdg>intelligent mind</rdg></app></l>
<l><del>That</del><add>Which</add> still went with me: <del>Had</del><add>had</add> to live <del>aloft</del><add>a life</add></l>
<l>Of <app><rdg><del>d</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>carnage</del> daily</rdg>
<rdg>daily carnage</rdg></app>, and to sail abroad</l>
<l>A terror to all birds &amp; gentle beasts</l>
<l>That heard the rushing of my rapid wings!</l>
<l>A royal bird indeed—and thence alone</l>
<l>Whose inacessible pride of place was still</l>
<l>The solemn solitude of the mightiest hills,</l>
<l>And of the highest heavens</l>
</lg>

<lg><l part="F">But in truth,</l>
<l>Nor much, for many periods, had I need</l>
<l>To search for prey, for countless hosts of men</l>
<l>Were mustered forth o'er all the face of earth</l>
<l>Casting a <app><rdg><del>fatal</del></rdg>

<l>In whose red surges cities thronged with men.</l>

<l>That rang so late with rural thankfulness</l>

<l>Were whelmed in one wild doom, and from the earth</l>

<rdg><del><unclear/></del></rdg>
<rdg>masses</rdg></app>, in their might,</l>
<l>Rushed at each other with a dreadful roar</l>

<l>Into mere make-believe:—rushed on to wounds</l>
<l>And <del><unclear/></del> sumless slaughter, with a madness such</l>

<metamark>x</metamark> <l>Or else about <del><unclear/></del><add>fenced</add> cities they would pitch</l>

<l>And even scandalised at what I saw:</l>
<l>I said my Realm <add>is</add> large—and I will hold</l>
<l>My state in all its regions; and though still</l>
<l>The savage instincts of my Eagle life</l>

<del><l>Was softened, and my fate as cast</l></del>

<l>Into a mould <del>more</del><add>even</add> capable of joy</l>

<l>Would shoot an arrow at <add>me</add> as I soared</l>
<l><del>Over</del><add>Above</add> the populations. <del>More and more I felt</del><add>It was plain</add></l>
<l>That solaces, though few and far between</l>
<l>Were added to <del>my life</del><add>me</add>—and <add>I</add> thence derived</l>
<l>Even <del>from</del><add>in</add> the musings of my Egle-heart</l>
<l>A feeling, that was day by day conformed</l>
<l>That not for ever was my soul condemned</l>
<l>To suffer in the body of a Brute!</l>
<l>For though the memory of the towering crimes</l>
<l>And matchless lusts that filled my whole career</l>
<l>While human, still was within evermore</l>
<l>No longer did they shed about my <app><rdg><del>ways</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>ways</del></rdg><rdg>life</rdg></app></l>
<l>That scorpian venom whose so subtle fire</l>
<l>Once burnt like blight. Nay I remembered <del>oft</del><add>well</add></l>
<l>How often I had looked with longing eyes</l>
<l>Up at the clear Egyptian heaven, and watched</l>
<l>The <del>hands</del><add>wings</add> that clove them, envying every bird:</l>
</lg>

<pb n="145" facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689c/148"/>

<lg><l>That, soaring in the sunshine, seemed to be</l>
<l>Exempt from all the grovelling cares of men!</l>
<l><del>I oft</del><add>Oft I</add> remememberd how, even in my most</l>
<l>Triumphant moment I had wished to exchange</l>
<l>My being with an ibis which was then</l>
<l>Floating away, upon his speckled wings</l>
<l><del><unclear/></del> Tow'rds Memphis, at a height in heaven, <del><unclear/></del><add>secure</add></l>
<l><del>To envy</del><add>From hurt</add> and <del>to danger</del> inaccessible <add>to envy</add>!</l>
<l>I thought how <del>often <unclear/></del><add>oft</add>, when with my hunting train</l>
<l>In that rude region spread about the cataracts</l>
<l>I had watched the eagles as they rose aloft</l>
<l>Into the lovely blue, and saw them turn</l>
<l>As through the colored clouds still up they went</l>
<l>Against the sunshine, into feathered <del>frames</del><add>flags</add></l>
<l>Of royal purple, edged with burning gold</l>

<l>Was somewhad <del><unclear>Eclectic</unclear></del><add>noble</add>—but to more at will</l>
<l>With a rapidity through bond lies space</l>

<l>Asensibility to beautious things</l>
