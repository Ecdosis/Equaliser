<l><app><rdg><del>Well nigh </del></rdg>
<rdg><del>Wholly </del></rdg>
<rdg><add>Merely </add></rdg></app>Incredible!—While in <del>the halls disposed</del><add>every hall</add>,</l>

<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/210" n="205"/>
<l>Short time for wonder had the Rabbi, ere</l>
<l><del>A page approached</del><add>The page returned</add> and led him to a still</l>
<l>And distant chamber, where the sick one lay.</l>
<l>Which entering soon, such brilliance met his gaze</l>
<l>As shrank the costliness of all that he</l>
<l>Had erewhile seen, though wondrous. Small indeed</l>
<l>This chamber was as with the rest compared,</l>
<l>Yet obviously contrived to fit a nice</l>
<l>And individual privacy. <del>But</del> <add>While</add> all</l>
<l>Within it showed a sumptuousness extreme,</l>
<l>And told of lavish habits,—glowing all</l>
<l>With purple &amp; gold, or interblazing quick</l>
<l>With royal jewels of a <del>nameless price:</del><add>sumless worth</add></l>
<l><del>While</del><add>And</add> in the midst of all this orient pomp,</l>
<l>On profuse pillows of the swan's new down,</l>
<l>Encased in the soft silk of Shiraz,—lo,</l>
<l>A queen-like Woman lay:—so beautiful,</l>
<l>That though upon her moon
<app><rdg><del>-like viz</del></rdg><rdg>visage, pain</rdg>
<rdg><add>bright</add> visage, pain</rdg></app></l>
<l>And languor, like eclipsing shadows, <del>lay</del>,<add> gloomed,</add></l>
<l>The ancient Rabbi's pious heart was thrilled</l>
<l>With singular tremours as he looked upon her.</l>
<l>Young was she—but alas! from time to time,</l>
<l>Oer her fair face a hetic flush would break,</l>
<l>To leave that utter pallor which portends</l>
<l>The nearness of the tomb.</l>

<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/211" n="206"/>
<lg><l part="F">From youth to age,</l>
<l>Much had the Rabbi Joseph sought in herbs</l>
<l>And minerals, the virtues they possess,</l>
<l>Soothing or pungent; and, by mixing these,</l>
<l>And so <del>uniting</del><add>completing</add> them in their effects,</l>
<l>With absolute integrity of art,</l>
<l>Had <del>,</del> for all ailmemts<del>,</del> fit medicaments.</l>
<l>Of these he offered her what to him seemed</l>
<l>Then needful. But the dying Woman said:</l>
<l>Alas! I want not these, nor did I send</l>
<l>To implore thy presence, thinking thou couldst cure</l>
<l>A malady <del>as</del><add>like</add> mine,—so fell and fatal—</l>
<l>Yea, fatal as the funeral steps of Time!</l>
<l>But simply that I might <del>unload</del><add>discharge</add> my mind</l>
<l>Of a dread secret that has been to <app><rdg><del>t</del></rdg><rdg>me</rdg></app></l>
<l>An ever-haunting and most <del>ominous</del><add>ghostly</add> fear,</l>
<l>Hanging and darkening like <del>a thunder</del><add>an ominous</add> cloud</l>
<l>O'er all the ways and prospects of my life,</l>
<l>And which must <del>quench</del><add>end</add> it ere the <del>morn arise</del><add>morning comes</add>.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">The Rabbi answered: If indeed it stand</l>
<l>Within my power to serve thee, pour at once</l>
<l>Thy sorrow out before me. But, if not,</l>
<l>And if thy <del>secret have a deadly</del><add>woe hath any mortal</add> taint,</l>
<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/212" n="207"/>
<l>Forbear, O Woman to acquaint my soul</l>
<l>With aught that <del>it would seek not if itself advised,</del> <add>if advised, it would not seek,</add></l>
<add><l><del>Nor for itself, nor others.</del><add><metamark>x</metamark> Though covetous of wisdom:</add> Or with aught</l></add>

<l><del>Upon the</del><add>The</add> memory of a man of Israel.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1"><del>"</del>I am, said she, the daughter of thy friend</l>
<l>Rabbi Ben Bachai—be his memory blessed!</l>
<l>But now the widow of a Prince, though one</l>
<l>Of Ishmael's race. Behold you this abode!</l>
<l><del>This</del> Did ever yet the tent-born Arab build</l>
<l>Thus for his pride or pleasure? See you all</l>
<l>These riches! Tell me, when were such amassed</l>
<l>By the grey Desert's wild &amp; wandering son?</l>
<l>Riches he could not even hoard in dreams,</l>
<l>As not by him conceivable. Ah, no!</l>
<l>Deadly and desperate was the game that <del>gained</del><add>won</add> them!</l>
<l>And with a burning bitterness at best</l>
<l>Have I enjoyed them ever. And at last</l>
<l>How vainly now <del>do I repent</del> <add>would I forego</add> them <del>gainless</del><add>all</add></l>
<l>And mend with a repentant <del>hand</del><add>heed</add> my peace</l>
<l>In abject poverty. Their very lasts,</l>
<l>Though to my sense but as a thing foregone,</l>
<l>How vainly now do I abhor—too late!</l>
</lg>

<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/213" n="208"/>

<lg><l>Thus having spoken, calmly for awhile</l>
<l>In her pale loveliness she lay, with looks</l>
<l>Dreamily self-involved,—as if her mind</l>
<l>Were vaguely roaming in the fatal Past:</l>
<l>When suddenly her beauteous countenance grew</l>
<l>Bedimmed and dreary, like <del>a moon eclipsed;</del> <add>the eclipsed moon;</add></l>
<l>Then darkened more, and writhed with horrid pangs<del>;</del></l>
<add><l>Frightful to see; while evermore in this</l></add>
<l><del>Till in</del>the burning agony she tosses about</l>
<l><del>About</del><add>Madly</add> convulsed, and from her foaming lips</l>
<l>Words so weird a meaning smite the ear</l>
<l>Of Rabbi Joseph, that he bowed his head</l>
<l>And cast his eyes in <add>holy</add> terror <del>on the ground</del><add>down</add>!</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">And thus a space, bowed rigidly, he stood</l>
<l>As one transfixed—though pitying, and with prayer</l>
<l>Strengthening his soul. And when again his looks</l>
<l>He lifted to the Woman—lo, that face</l>
<l>Which erewhile showed so ghastly-wild and weird,</l>
<l>Was cloudless as a summer heaven! The late</l>
<l>Dark brow was bright; the late pale cheek suffused</l>
<l>As with inevitable roseate bloom;</l>
<l>And wondrous more than all, her eyes that seemed</l>
<l>Before so sunken and so weary, now</l>
<l>Were big with splendor, and around her shot</l>
<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/214" n="209"/>
<l>Electric influence! while her lips that erst</l>
<l>Were thin &amp; faded as autumnal leaves,</l>
<l>Now full and crimson, curled with stormy pride,</l>
<l>Or quivered with a fierce <del>[voluptous power.]</del> voluptuousness.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">Well might the Rabbi stand in disbelief</l>
<l>Of all that now he saw. Could thus be she</l>
<l><del>Beside</del><add>By</add> whom, <add>as</add> dying, he so late had knelt?</l>
<l>This bold and beauteous being that now looked</l>
<l>So lovely-fierce—yea, terrible, in all</l>
<l>The bright audacity of passionate power?</l>
<l>But seeing his amazement, thus she spake.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">"These are the common changes of the fell</l>
<l>And fatal ailment, that with torments strange</l>
<l>And varied, as thou seest, is tearing up</l>
<l>The dark foundations of my mortal state,</l>
<l>And sinking all its structures, hour by hour,</l>
<l>Into the dust of Death. But nothing now</l>
<l>Is left me, but to meet <app>
<rdg><del>the</del></rdg>
<rdg>my <del>coming</del></rdg>
<rdg>nearing doom</rdg></app></l>
<l>As best I may, and suffer."</l>
</lg>

<lg><l part="F">Hearing which,</l>
<l>The Rabbi in his wisdom knew that she</l>
<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/215" n="210"/>
<l>Was troubled thus by the indwelling power</l>
<l>Of some strong Spirit of Evil, and on this</l>
<l>Sent straightway for an unction, wherewith erst</l>
<l>The famous ansestor whose name he bore,—</l>
<l>Herod the Great's chief hakim,—had expelled</l>
<l>The Demon haunter of the dying King.</l>
<l>'Twas brought him, and therewith did he at once</l>
<l>Annoint her forehead, and her eyes, and touch</l>
<l>The tips of all her fingers. <del>Then</del><add>Next</add> he made</l>
<l>Within a consecrated crucible,</l>
<l>A fire of citron-wood and cinnamon;</l>
<l><app><rdg><del>And</del> splashed</rdg>
<rdg><del>Then splashed</del></rdg>
<rdg><del>Splash</del></rdg>
<rdg>And splashed</rdg></app> the flames with insense,—every rite</l>
<l>Inspiriting with <del>customary</del><add>the influence</add> prayers.</l>
<l>Then as the smoke arose, he bowed her head</l>
<l>Into its coils, that so she might imbibe</l>
<l>The salutary odour, till the Fiend</l>
<l>That dwelt within her should be thence expelled.</l>
</lg>

<lg><l rend="indent1">Again a change came over her. Her face</l>
<l>Once more grew pale with pain; once more she writhed</l>
<l>In burning torment, uttering many words</l>
<l>Of most unhallowed meaning! Yet her eyes</l>
<l>Were fixed the while, and motionless her lips!</l>
<l>Whereby the Rabbi <del>knew</del> certainly perceived</l>
<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/216" n="211"/>
<l>'Twas not the Woman of herself that spake—</l>
<l>But the dread Spirit that <del>ruled over her:</del><add>possessed her soul.</add></l>
<l>And thus it cried aloud:</l>
</lg>
<del><head>Part II</head></del>
<lg><l part="F">"Why am I here<add>, in this my last resort,</add></l>
<l>Purturbed with incense and annointings? Why</l>
<l>Compelled to listen to the sound of prayers</l>
<l><del>Which</del><add>That</add> smite me through as with the fire of God <del>,</del><add>!</add></l>
<l><del>Reddened with wrath!</del><add>O pain, pain, pain</add> What of this Chamber be</l>
<l>So full of <hi rend="ul">us</hi>—for Legion is our name—</l>
<l>Yet look around! Is it not also full</l>
<l>Of our immitigable punishers?</l>
<l>Full of avenging Angels, holding each</l>
<l>A scourge of thunder in his potent hand,</l>
<l>Ready to lighten forth! and who, then armed,</l>
<l>For ever chase and wound us as we fly!</l>
<l>Nor end with this—but in each wound they make</l>
<l>Pour <del>poison</del><add>venom</add> sweltered from that tree Asgard,</l>
<l>Whose <del>mortal</del><add>deadly</add> shadow in its blackness falls</l>
<l>Over the lake of everlasting doom!</l>
<l><del>Why thus countenanced! What have I to confess?</del></l>
<l>—Five hundred years ago, I who thus speak,</l>
<l>Was an Egyptian, living at the Court</l>

<l>The fierce dissatisfaction of my soul,</l>
<l>Returning, knawed me, and I cursed my fate!</l>
<l>Where at the withered <del>C</del><add>C</add>reature laughed in scorn,</l>
<l>And mocked me with the malice of his eyes;</l>

<l>Then, on a suden, with an oath that seemed</l>

<l>More beautiful than beseemed a mortal man—</l>
<l>Yea, beautiful as Thammuz! Nor was changed</l>
<l>My person only; but my heart and head.</l>
<l>Ambition wilder than a leopard's thirst</l>

<l>Some leisure now was mine for paying off</l>
<l>Each old unsettled score; and so between</l>
<l>I set myself to ruin all who erst</l>

<l>Out of all posts, all places; for <del>in vain</del> though Time</l>
<l>And change had much dispersed them through the land,</l>
<l>Not the less surely <del>had</del><add>did</add>, in briefest space</l>

<l>The more I hurled the mighty from their seats</l>

<l>From bad to worse, corrupting as I went</l>
<l>The lowly, making them more abject yet;</l>
<l>Awing; as with a thunder-bearing hand,</l>
<l>The high and affluent; while I bound the strong</l>

<l>Standing above him!—one of the high Sons</l>

<l>O'er Israel's progeny, where'er dispersed.</l>

<l>The air wide round with intervolving <del>flames</del><add>gleams</add>,</l>
<l>And flashes as of lightning. But ere long</l>
<l>The evil king fell conquered. From the ground</l>
<l>Then sprang he, cursing,—up into a cloud</l>
<l>That moved aloft, low thundering as it went.</l>
<l>Then came the Son of Paradise and stood</l>
<l>Over me, where I lay, and with a face</l>
<l>Influenced <add>as</add> with <del>a</del> majestic wrath, he said</l>
<l>'O child of guilt, should vengeance not be wrought</l>

<l>I clasped his radiant knees,—I wept,—I groaned</l>
<l>And beat my bosom in my wild <del>affright!</del><add>distress!</add></l>
<l>At last the glorious Vision, who had held</l>
<l>The blow suspended still, spake thus: 'Thou'st spared;</l>
<l>From no weak pity, but because thou art</l>
<l>Descended from an Israelite mother:</l>
<l><del>B</del><add>For that cause spared;</add>—yet must though at my hands</l>

<l>He laid his hand with a life-crushing might</l>

<lg><l>Awaking as from sleep, I bounded up</l>
<l>Strung with a feeling of gigantic strength</l>
<l>Though yet half wild with horror. Onward then</l>
<l>Bounding I went;—out through the palace-gates—</l>
<l>Down through the streets, and into the highways,</l>
<l>Astonished at my own miraculous speed!</l>
<l>And now afar, a long-drawn line appeared</l>
<l>Of Alexandrian merchants, on their way</l>
<l>Over the desert of Pentapolis</l>
<l>And strange the instinct <add>seemed</add> that urged me <del>now</del><add>then</add></l>
<l>To rush amongst them—and drown; <add>for I</add></l>
<l><del>For I</del> Was fierce with hunger &amp; inflamed with thirst</l>
<l>On<del>rushing</del> <add><unclear>jumping</unclear></add>, suddenly I sprang amidst</l>
<l>A laggard company that still beside</l>
<l>A clear spring rested, as for the last time;—</l>
<l>One of those clear springs, that like <del>sl</del><add>silver</add> shields</l>
<l>Gleam on the <del>borders of</del><add>burning borders</add> of the grey</l>
<l>Enormous Desert. All at once they rose</l>
<l>At sight of me, and made a <del>hideous</del><add>startling</add> outcry</l>
<l>Some fled—some threw themselves amongst the brakes</l>
<l>Some seized their swords and lances, and so stood</l>
<l>As if on their defence: all which to see</l>
<l>Filled me at once with unaccountable rage</l>
<l>And savage joy! The <del>gl</del><add>very gleam</add> of <del>steel!</del><add>their protending spears</add></l>
<l>Seemed to insult me, and I rushed upon them</l>
<l>But as I did so, a sudden spasm of pain</l>
<l>Scorched all my side—a lance was quivering in it!</l>
<pb facs="/corpix/english/harpur/h689/h689a/233" n="228"/>
<l>I roared a roar that even appalled myself,</l>
<l>And bounding, irresistible <del>as a hurricane,</del> it seemed,</l>
<add><l>As some huge payment from a <del>c</del><add>crag</add> dislodged,</l></add>
<l>Against the puny <del>creature</del><add>wight</add> that <del>assailed me</del><add>had assailed me</add>,</l>
<l>Instantly tore him, as he were a kid,</l>
<l>All into gory shreds! The rest all fled</l>

<l>So <app><rdg><del>fazed</del></rdg><rdg><del><unclear/></del></rdg><rdg>parched</rdg></app> was I with thirst, so faint with heat,</l>
<l>And weared <del>also with</del><add>by</add> my rampant race that day</l>
<l>Under the burning sun. <del>And lo</del><add>Besides,</add> the well</l>

<l>I rushed to it—I stooped to drink—Alas!</l>
<l><del>Bending</del><add>Stooping</add> reversed within the lucid lymph,</l>
<l>Behold there stood a monstrous Lion—Yea!</l>
<l>I saw his shaggy mane! I saw his red</l>

<l><del>His back, that like</del><add>His rough and grinning lips</add>! his monstrous fangs</l>
<l>That like discolored rows of ivory spikes</l>
<l>Were foul with gore, and hung with dripping strings—</l>
<l>The muscular integuments of the slain!</l>
<l>I shrank away in horrible putrurbation!</l>
<l>But soon returned, to stoop and slake at one</l>
<l>My unsupportable thirst.—Alas! alas!</l>

<l>At length was quencht; what might appease—the fierce</l>

<l><del>Away</del><add>And off</add> I bounded, tearing up the sands</l>

<l>Find haply some remission from the keen</l>
<l>And scarcly memory of my former state!</l>

<l><add>With whirlwind speed,</add> was now my daily wont</l>
<l>For all things fled before me—all things shrunk</l>
