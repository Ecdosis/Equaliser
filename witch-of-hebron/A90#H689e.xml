<note resp="MJS">Lines from Part VII of The Witch of Hebron, a later version than the complete poem on p. <ref target="H689a">202f.</ref> of the manuscript (transcription not corrected). A difficult hand: "Cought up the draft" probably meant to be "Caught up the drift" as in later versions; I can't quite read "mulberries" (cf. <ref target="http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozedits/harpur/A97/00000227.jpg">p. 226</ref> in MS A97) from "[?]malterras".</note>
<note resp="DS">Harpur crosses his l's and h's all the time, and fails to dot his i's. Mulberries is the only thing that makes sense.</note>

<head type="parthead">Part VII.</head>

<lg><l>Again I had some deep-down hold on being</l>
<l>Dim as an oyster's in its ocean bed.</l>
<l>An aboriginal inception, like</l>
<l><del>The interknitting of live</del><add>Quick interknitting</add> knots of <del>strings</del><add>living roots</add></l>
<l>Which terminated all in one smooth surface:</l>
<l>Strong suctatorial powers; and could detect</l>
<l>Sweet food from sour—warm presences from cold.</l>
<l><del>I</del><add>And</add> was beyond all doubt some living thing—</l>
<l>Some little vital centre, <del>around</del><add>upon</add> which</l>
<l>Much comfortable influence impinged</l>
<l>But best I can recall, with what entire</l>
<l>Content I nestled betwixt two warm paps,</l>
<l>Each with its many-porous tap, both shaped</l>
<l>And colored both,—yea, to the very life</l>
<l>Like two ripe mulberries of Palestine</l>
<l>And from which, when I listed, <del>and</del> without stint</l>
<l>I drew a liquid that was meat and drink.</l>
<l>At length I could distinguish faces, forrms,</l>
<l>An strove to <app><rdg>imitate</rdg><rdg>imitate</rdg></app> the sounds I heard</l>
<l>Cought up the draft of speech, and knew at last</l>
<l>That all who came to see me &amp; admire</l>
<l>Call me Ben Bachai's daughter</l></lg>
